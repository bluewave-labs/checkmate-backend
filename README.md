<p align="center"><strong>The backend service for Checkmate, an open source uptime and infrastructure monitoring application</strong></p>

This repository contains the **backend** of Checkmate, which handles data processing, storage, and API services for the Checkmate monitoring tool. The backend is responsible for managing uptime checks, handling real-time alerts, and storing historical monitoring data. It integrates seamlessly with the [Checkmate frontend](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/checkmate) and can be deployed independently.

Checkmate's backend is designed to be lightweight and scalable, ensuring reliable performance even with a high number of active monitors.
